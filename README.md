# focusr-android
Stay focused while using your Android. By default, counts down 10 minutes for facebook.com in Chrome per day. 

Currently can track the following native apps: Facebook, Snapchat, Pinterest, Chrome, Materialistic. Let me know if there are more you want.

# Install
Download the [demo apk](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9NKfaR-dK3vT3lWMWI5TTRvRDA) to your phone and install.

Once the app opens, tap "Tap here to enable in settings" > "Focusr" > switch on. 

If you want to track native apps, check them off in the preferences.

# How it works
Uses the Android Accessibility API to watch which apps open and close, and for Chrome, what URL is in the search bar.

It's a fairly scary permission to grant. I'm open sourcing this so you know the app isn't sending your data anywhere.
